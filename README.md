1. Create a class called "BankAccount" with the following properties:
 private string "accountNumber"
 private decimal "balance"
2. Implement a constructor that takes the account number as a parameter and
initializes the "accountNumber" property. The "balance" should be set to 0 by
default.
3. Create a method called "Deposit" that takes an amount (decimal) as a parameter
and adds it to the balance.
4. Create a method called "Withdraw" that takes an amount (decimal) as a parameter
and subtracts it from the balance.
5. Create an instance of the "BankAccount" class, perform a deposit of 1000 units,
and then withdraw 500 units. Print out the final balance.
